# Building Brainality Engine

Building this engine should be relatively straight forward, especially if you experience with Haxe already.

## Dependencies

- For Windows, you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022

If you don't already have have install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), preferably the latest version, but older versions will probably work.

Once that's installed run `haxe --version` to check if it's installed correctly. If you see something like `4.3.7`, you're good to go!

Next, clone the repository.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Brainfunk-Team/Brainality-Engine.git
```

Make sure to run this in the correct directory or you'll have to move it, which would be annoying.

Now, run setup/YOUROS.bat/.sh file in this repository.
<br>(Unix is for Linux and macOS)

You should be able to just do ./FILENAME, but I don't use windows and don't really know how it works, so tell me if I'm wrong.

Finally, you can run `lime test cpp` and the engine will compile! Yippee!
